abstract = {The use of cheating software in video games to gain an unfair advantage has required the use of anti-cheat software and deterrents such as account bans. Anti-cheat software is, however, always a step behind the opposition and as such new and innovative solutions are required. This paper considers AI driven tools as one such approach and compared decision trees, SVMs and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classifiers in an attempt to classify cheating and honest player behaviour. The results of the research highlighted the potential for mouse dynamics as a measure of player behaviour, and decision trees as the most accurate detector of honest player behaviour.},
